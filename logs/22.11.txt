Meeting Notes

achieved goals:
- enhance plot (show missing)
- fill in missing values with neighboring values / look for other techniques https://towardsdatascience.com/4-techniques-to-handle-missing-values-in-time-series-data-c3568589b5a8
- implement models on sleep stage data only: knn classification
- more research -> Ernesto's playlist:
    - mse vs dynamic time wrapping with KNN?
    - deep learning
    - unsupervised learning

next goals:
- elif check patient 15! date format! is emfit sleepstages mapped right?
- elif create (5 stage sleep stages) & raw datas & remove beginning/end wake
- enhance plot (at which psg values is nan for radar)
- abdullah fillin
- abdullah ml model on sleep stage fusion
- ernesto model plans:
    - CNN on raw before classification
    - deep learning paper


additional notes:
- can we use primary diagnoses for separating models?
- prepare patient data methods

next meeting:
- patient 038 has only WAKE stage in radar
