Meeting Notes

achieved goals:
- produce single ground truths format files for all patients
- visualise sleep stages periods of sensors, mat and ground truth
- try utils functions
- literature review on time series classification / sleep stages analysis

next goals:
- enhance plot (show missing)
- fill in missing values with neighboring values / look for other techniques https://towardsdatascience.com/4-techniques-to-handle-missing-values-in-time-series-data-c3568589b5a8
- implement models on sleep stage data only: weighted classification (GD)
- more research -> Ernesto's playlist:
    - mse vs dynamic time wrapping with KNN?
    - deep learning
    - unsupervised learning

additional notes:
- can we use primary diagnoses for separating models?
- prepare patient data methods
